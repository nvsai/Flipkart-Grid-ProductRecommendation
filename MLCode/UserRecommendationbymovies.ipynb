        "This code first loads the movie ratings data into a Pandas DataFrame. Then, it creates a user-item rating matrix, which is a matrix that contains the ratings that each user has given to each movie. Next, it calculates the user similarities using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of how similar two variables are. A value of 1 indicates that the two variables are perfectly correlated, a value of 0 indicates that there is no correlation, and a value of -1 indicates that the two variables are perfectly inversely correlated. In this case, we are using the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the similarity between users' movie ratings.\n",

It does this by getting the merchandise products that the similar users have rated and then calculating the weighted average of the merchandise product ratings.

The code then sorts the merchandise products by the weighted average rating and prints the top 5 recommended merchandise products."
